This program allows Smith students to track progress in their major by comparing courses they have already taken/planned to take and comparing it to data mined from the 2017-2018 course catalog. Currently only applies for a fraction of the majors offered by Smith College.

To run: open advis-a-tron.html in browser (must be run in Firefox!). A general understanding of Smith course numbers is required.
